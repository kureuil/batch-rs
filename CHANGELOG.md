## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Batch is now split up in multiple crates, making it a lot more modular.
- **all**: The terminology was changed from "task" to "job".

### Added
- **core**: Added support for job priorities, with 5 levels of granularity: `TRIVIAL`, `LOW`, `NORMAL` (default), `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`.
- **codegen**: The `job` procedural macro to declare jobs.
- **core:** A bunch of traits to allow the use of other message brokers than RabbitMQ.
- **core**: The `Properties` struct, store the metadata associated to a job (timeout, priority, name, etc).
- **rabbitmq**: The `exchanges` and `queues` procedural macros, used to declare RabbitMQ exchanges and queues, which APIs are more strongly typed.

### Fixed
- **rabbitmq:** Exchange name not being used when publishing a task to RabbitMQ.
- **all**: No more `.unwrap()` in documentation examples.
- **all**: Removed last occurences of dangerous `.unwrap()` in the library.

### Removed
- **codegen**: The custom derive for the `Task` trait has been removed, use the `job` procedural macro instead.
