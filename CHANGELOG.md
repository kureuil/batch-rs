## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added support for task priorities, with 5 levels of granularity: `TRIVIAL`,
`LOW`, `NORMAL` (default), `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`.
- Methods on `Query`, `ExchangeBuilder` & `QueueBuilder`, making extension
methods more useful.

### Fixed
- Exchange name not being used when publishing a task to RabbitMQ.
- No more `.unwrap()` in documentation examples.
- Removed last occurences of dangerous `.unwrap()` in the library.

### Changed
- The task name generated by the `Task` derive now takes the current module into
account, avoiding name collision of tasks having the same name in different
modules.
